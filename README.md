# HydMetro-shortestPath-Dijkistraalorithm
The provided code implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between 
two stations in a transportation network. It uses an adjacency list to represent the 
network and calculates the shortest distances from the source station to all other stations. 
The code then retrieves the shortest path using the calculated distances and prints it as output. 
The main method prompts the user to select the source and destination stations, and the shortest path is displayed.
